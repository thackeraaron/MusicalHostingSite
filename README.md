# MusicalHostingSite
I got bored so turned a hosting company website into a musical instrument

Here is [a video of it working](https://i.imgur.com/INLTfUn.mp4){:target="_blank"}

## Instructions
- run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- open https://eternalweb.uk/whmcs/index.php or https://web.archive.org/web/20200814002519/https://eternalweb.uk/whmcs/index.php
- ensure the circle rotating buttons are visible
- run `python play.py`

## TODO
- Make a good README
